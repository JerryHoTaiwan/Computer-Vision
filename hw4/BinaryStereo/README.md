Binary Stereo Matching ICPR 2012

A fast binary stereo matching algorithm. To run the code, put all files into a single project or makefile. The only 3rd-party dependency is [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/).

**Note: a simple Makefile has been added so that you can compile the project by make  once OpenCV is configured on Linux/Unix platform.**
